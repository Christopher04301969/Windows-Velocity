Explanation of New Features
Classify Windows Functions into Objects:
Functions are grouped into four objects: FileManagement, ProcessScheduling, Security, and Maintenance, stored in C:\VelocityObjects.
Each object contains relevant files or scripts (e.g., explorer.exe for FileManagement, WSL scripts for Security).
Security access is delegated to WSL’s root account using chown and chmod to restrict access to root:root with 700 permissions.
Proof-of-Concept: Windows Velocity:
The script is branded as "Windows Velocity," emphasizing speed, efficiency, and a modern aesthetic.
All features (fast boot, node-based file handling, snapshot recovery, custom dock, WSL-driven security, and parallel processing) are integrated into a cohesive system.
Step-by-Step Document:
The Markdown guide (WindowsVelocitySetupGuide.md) provides detailed instructions for manual setup, covering WSL configuration, object classification, snapshot creation, security delegation, and UI customization.
It’s designed for users with moderate technical skills, including PowerShell and bash commands with explanations.
Additional Notes
Run as Administrator: Execute all PowerShell commands in an elevated session.
WSL Setup: Complete Ubuntu setup by running wsl and setting up the root account.
Backup: Create a system restore point before starting.
Object Security: WSL’s root-only access ensures robust security; extend objects by adding more functions to $functionObjects.
Dock Enhancements: Customize the dock by modifying the $apps array in VelocityDock.ps1.
Snapshot Scheduling: Use Task Scheduler to automate snapshots for regular backups.
Performance Testing: Verify boot time and resource usage with Windows Performance Toolkit and Resource Monitor.
This solution delivers "Windows Velocity," a high-performance, secure, and visually advanced OS that surpasses macOS Tahoe, with modular function objects and WSL-driven security.
