Purpose: This code defines the core .NET services for Windows Velocity. The FileManagementService organizes files into nodes, ProcessSchedulingService adjusts process priorities, SnapshotService creates periodic OS snapshots, VelocityInstallerService enhances installation processes, SupervisorService monitors performance and snapshots, and SecurityService handles authentication. The services use gRPC for communication and are secured with JWT tokens.

3.2 WSL Security Scripts
WSL is used to secure .NET services and the installer by enforcing Linux permissions and verifying package integrity.
